        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A timeless classic, boneless pasta was invented when Johnathan Cheflord first dared to ask: 
           "What if you could make pasta without all the human bones in it?" This dish is enjoyed by many
            across the world, and is a staple of many a modern household.
