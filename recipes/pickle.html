        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everybody loves a good, crunchy pickle. We can all relate to the 
            age-old stereotype of pulling our pocket-pickles out and enjoying a nice pickley 
            snack during our daily commute. This recipe is an ode to our timeless companion:
            the pickle.
