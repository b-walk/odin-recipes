        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The homestyle yankee with no brim is a newcomer to the cooking scene, but is already beloved by many,
            especially those who enjoy reviving decrepit memes that were never really that funny to begin with.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Exactly 1.2 yankees</li>
            <li>A disdain for brims, and, all the more disdain for <em>yankees</em> with brims</li>
            <li>Footlong machete</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the machete, remove exactly 0.2 yankees from the yankal mass</li>
            <li>Setting aside the newly shorn yankee, place the 0.2 yankees that were just removed in a pile to later be repurposed</li>
            <li>Using the machete, carefully slice the brim section cleanly off of the yankee (ignore its pleas for mercy)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
